Developed an employee management system (EMS) using a Java full stack approach involves creating a web application that allows an organization to manage its employee data efficiently. Here's a short introduction to building such a system, covering the key components and technologies involved:

Key Components 
Front-End used:
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
JavaScript: For client-side scripting.
Front-End Framework: React Js and Vite Js

Back-End used:
Java: The core programming language used for server-side logic.
Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building microservices and RESTful APIs in Java.

Database used:
SQL Database: MySQL for storing employee data.

APIs:
RESTful Services: For communication between the front-end and back-end.

Technologies and Tools
Maven: For project build and dependency management.
Postman: For API testing.

Basic Features of the EMS
User Authentication and Authorization:
Secure login and role-based access control.

Employee Management:
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee records.
Viewing employee details.
Searching and filtering employees.

Workflow Overview
Front-End:
UI Design: Design the user interface using HTML, CSS, and a front-end framework.
API Integration: Use JavaScript to call back-end APIs for data operations.

Back-End:
API Development: Use Spring Boot to create RESTful APIs for handling employee data.
Repository Layer: Interact with the database using Spring Data JPA.

Database:
Schema Design: Create tables for employees, departments, and other related entities.
Data Access: Use JPA repositories to perform CRUD operations on the database.

Set Up the Project:
Initialize a new Spring Boot project using spring initializer.
Set up the front-end using a JavaScript framework in visual studio code.

Create Database Schema:
Design and create the necessary tables in MySQL.

Develop Back-End APIs:
Implement RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.
Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.
Implement above features in IntelliJ IDEA platform.
Implement API calls for CRUD operations.
Testing and Deployment:

Test the application using tools like Postman and JUnit.
Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform.
